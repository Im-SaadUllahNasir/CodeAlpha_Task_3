# Sales Prediction Project

## Overview
The **Sales Prediction Project** is a data science project aimed at predicting future sales based on historical data. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to forecast sales for a given product, store, or region, helping businesses optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and sales forecasting.

The project involves the collection of sales data, preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a predictive model to make future sales predictions.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Collect historical sales data, including features such as product details, store location, seasonality, promotions, etc.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between sales and other factors.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales.
- **Model Evaluation & Tuning**: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it to achieve optimal accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical operations)
  - Matplotlib (Data visualization)
  - Seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms)
  - XGBoost (Ensemble learning algorithm)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Git (optional for version control)

4. Open the `notebooks/01_data_cleaning.ipynb` file to begin exploring the data.

### Running the Model
To train and evaluate the predictive model, use the code provided in the `03_modeling.ipynb` notebook or run the scripts in the `src/` directory.

## Data Description
- **Sales Data**: Historical data that includes information about sales transactions such as the quantity sold, product ID, store ID, date, and sales value.
- **External Factors**: Additional data like promotional activities, weather data, holidays, or any other factors that may influence sales.
- **Processed Data**: Cleaned and transformed dataset ready for analysis and model training.

## Key Insights
- The project analyzes the impact of different factors on sales, such as promotions, seasonality, product categories, and weather patterns.
- The predictive model can forecast future sales, allowing businesses to better prepare for demand fluctuations, optimize inventory levels, and plan marketing strategies.
- Insights from the analysis can help businesses improve their decision-making processes and increase profitability.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Implement real-time sales predictions using live data streams.
- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with more complex machine learning algorithms such as deep learning or ensemble methods.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build interactive dashboards using tools like Dash or Streamlit to visualize the results of predictions and insights dynamically.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate more external factors like social media sentiment, local events, or competitor activities to improve model accuracy.
